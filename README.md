# Impact of Soft Mobility on Air Quality in Swiss Cities (2010â€“2023)

ðŸ“„ Empirical research project (HEC Lausanne).  
We investigate the effect of soft mobility infrastructures (bike lanes, pedestrian areas, green spaces, public transport stops) on air quality in 8 Swiss cities (2010â€“2023).  

## Data sources
- OpenStreetMap (via ohsome API)  
- Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN/OFEV)  
- Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO/OFS)  

## Methods
- Panel econometrics: Fixed Effects, First Differences, Lag models, Dynamic GMM  
- Tools: Python, Stata  

## Key findings
- Green spaces and public transport density significantly reduce NOâ‚‚ and PM10 levels.  
- Soft mobility infrastructures can act as levers for sustainable urban policies.
